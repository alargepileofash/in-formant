This application is a tool for analysing voices in real-time. It calculates information about resonance, pitch, and has planned support for vocal-fold-level features such as creak or breathiness.

It is primarily targeted at people who are seeking to train their voice, whether that be for voice actors, transgender and gender non-conforming people, or even singers. It may also prove useful to researchers as it allows the user to monitor vocal parameters with little delay and semi-automatic analysis.
